# codeLouisvilleProject
My project for Code Louisville using HTML, CSS and JavaScript
This is a portfolio for my husband.
In it you can find responsive design where the three images at the top of the screen go to one for mobile devices and the text stacks, as well as included a hamburger menu using javascript for small screens. I've embedded youtube videos on the home page, links to outside sites on the "popular contributions" page, and created a carousel of images on the "support me" page. The carousel has buttons that use javascript to go from one image to the next.
